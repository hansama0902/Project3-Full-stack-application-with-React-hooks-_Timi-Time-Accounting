## Project Objective
Timi Time Accounting is a full-stack web application designed for personal and family financial management, built using Node.js, Express 5, and MongoDB for the backend, and React with hooks for the frontend. The system is client-side rendered, using AJAX to asynchronously interact with the backend API, ensuring a responsive and seamless user experience.
