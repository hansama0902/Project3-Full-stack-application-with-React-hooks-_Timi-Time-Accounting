## Project Objective
**Timi Time Accounting** is a full-stack web application designed for personal and family financial management, built using Node.js, Express 5, and MongoDB for the backend, and React with hooks for the frontend. The system is client-side rendered, using AJAX to asynchronously interact with the backend API, ensuring a responsive and seamless user experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hansama0902/Project3-Full-stack-application-with-React-hooks-_Timi-Time-Accounting.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Project3-Full-stack-application-with-React-hooks-_Timi-Time-Accounting
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB Atlas URI.

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install its dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. **Build the Frontend**

   While in the `frontend` directory, build the React application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory containing the production-ready frontend files.

7. **Start the Backend Server**

   Return to the root directory and start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

   The server will serve both the backend API and the frontend application.
